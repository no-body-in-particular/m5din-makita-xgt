# m5din-makita-xgt
Lockout flag reset tool for makita XGT - based on https://github.com/twaymouth/XGT-Tester . 
Connection to m5din is wired thus, and a wire is pulled from the + of the battery to the pin above the DT pin, in case the BMS IC needs restarting.

You can find the pins on the battery here:

You will also need to solder over the fuse, the easiest way to do this, is to use a dremel or similar tool to scrape off the insulation layer on the top of the PCB as explained on my youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eV-fzQYKgs
