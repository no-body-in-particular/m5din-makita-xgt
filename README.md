# m5din-makita-xgt
Lockout flag reset tool for makita XGT - based on https://github.com/twaymouth/XGT-Tester . 
Connection to m5din is wired like this, you can just strip the ends of the wire of the m5din ( wire is bought separately on aliexpress or their store ) , and shove them in the battery.
A wire pulled from the + of the battery to the pin above the DT pin is needed in case the battery is completely dead and the BMS needs restarting.

You can find the pins on the battery here:

You will also likely need to solder over the fuse, the easiest way to do this, is to use a dremel or similar tool to scrape off the insulation layer on the top of the PCB as explained on my youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eV-fzQYKgs
